<h1>Those Who Believe</h1>
Those Who Believe is a top down 2d role-playing game. The name is not official and every file you see is currently in beta, so between now and whenever I finish this everything could change. 
<h2>What this is? </h2>
This is a game which started as a hello world program and grew as I slowly learned how to use Löve2D and I've made it into a little RPG game.
<h2>How do I play?</h2>
Well right now the game isn't even in beta. But if that doesn't scare you then here is the info

<h4>Newest Version</h4>
If you want to try out the most up-to-date(buggy) version then you will need to compile the project using the framework [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) and then clone my project
<h2> Why did you make this Game? </h2>
Well it orignally started as a small little Hello World project to learm how to use Löve2D and eventually I wanted a box which could move. Then I wanted a map, then I wanted a sword, then I wanted enemies and so on til it eventually became what it is now
<h3>Will it get better?</h3>
Yes! I will continue to develop this until I feel that the project is done. This could mean I either run the project into the ground and end up abandoning it or I continue developing it and eventually publicly release it.
<h2>Am I Dead</h2>
No, I am currently 'studying' Zelda: Breath of the Wild to learn more about game design and will return to this project with renewed eyes once I feel like I understand why that game was so fun and successful
