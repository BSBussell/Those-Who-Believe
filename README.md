# ProjectZ
This is ProjectZ. The name is not official and every file you see is currently in beta, so between now and whenever I finish this everything could change. 
# What this is? 
This is a game which started as a hello world program and grew as I slowly learned how to use Löve2D and I've made it into a little RPG game.
# How do I play?
Well right now the game isn't even in beta. But if that doesn't scare you then who am I to stop you.
First off you'll need to install [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) Then you can just drag the folder onto the application and It will compile.
# Why is it so Glitchy?
Well the game is still very early in development. In fact if your actually reading this then It's probably because your either a close friend or know me.
# Will it get better?
Yes! I will continue to develop this until I feel that the project is done. This could mean I either run the project into the ground and end up abandoning it or I continue developing it and eventually publicly release it.
