<h1>Project Z</h1>
This is ProjectZ. The name is not official and every file you see is currently in beta, so between now and whenever I finish this everything could change. 
<h2>What this is? </h2>
This is a game which started as a hello world program and grew as I slowly learned how to use Löve2D and I've made it into a little RPG game.
<h2>How do I play?</h2>
Well right now the game isn't even in beta. But if that doesn't scare you then who am I to stop you.
<h4>Mac OSX</h4>
If you are using a Mac then you can just download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xcxh6q2b8ql6wn7/Project%20Z.zip?dl=0)\n
<h4>Windows</h4>
First off you'll need to install [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) Then you can just drag the folder onto the application and It will compile.
<h2> Why is it so Glitchy?</h2>
Well the game is still very early in development. In fact if your actually reading this then It's probably because your either a close friend or know me.
<h3>Will it get better?</h3>
Yes! I will continue to develop this until I feel that the project is done. This could mean I either run the project into the ground and end up abandoning it or I continue developing it and eventually publicly release it.
